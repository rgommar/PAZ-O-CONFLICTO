Your Government has, together with the Government of Ecuador, conveyed to us its concern for having tried, throughout this long process and without achieving results that meet the expectations of both populations, to cover all aspects, as described by the Brasilia Declaration of November 26th, 1997, and the Rio de Janeiro Timetable on January 19th of the current year. As Your Excellency mentioned in the letter that was jointly sent with the President of Ecuador on the 8th of this month (October) to the President of Brazil, the difficulties encountered have to do with setting a Common Land Border in the area. 

Page 2, Par. 1: 
Accordingly, having complied with these requirements, we, Heads of State of the Guarantor Countries, in line with the Santiago Agreement and the Rio de Janeiro Timetable, express our point of view (which the parties accept as being of a binding nature), that contains the following elements to complete the establishment of a Common Land Border in the area and complement the comprehensive and definitive agreement

Page 2, Art.1:
1. In light of disagreement between the parties on  the views and opinions issued by the experts appointed by the Guarantor Countries, in line with the Brasilia Declaration timetable on the three items submitted for consideration, the Guarantor Countries of the Rio de Janeiro Protocol believe that such views are part of the implementation of the Rio de Janeiro Protocol and under the judgment of the Arbitrator Braz Dias de Aguiar, and that the parties must therefore proceed to finalize these borders in the manner established by these views and opinions. For this purpose, the annexed maps specify the coordinates of the landmarks to be erected

Page 3, Art.11:
11. Additionally, the parties will proceed to formalize projects put in place by the treaties and agreements, the texts of which are part of the comprehensive and definitive agreement that will put an end to the differences between the two countries. Moreover, we have the pleasure to inform you that, as stated in our communication of October 10th, this operation has been brought to the knowledge of His Holiness Pope John Paul II, who is pleased for this noble compromise and prays that the present agreement is the basis of a lasting coexistence in peace and prosperity of the fraternal people of Peru and Ecuador. 

Page 3, final paragraph:
The Guarantor Countries consider that the process born from the Peace Declaration of Itaramaty will be completed while respecting the interests and feelings of the two nations and ensuring the full and faithful implementation of the Rio de Janeiro Protocol. In this way, aspirations of peace, friendship and belief in a common future that the people of Peru and Ecuador seek may develop.

In recent weeks, a series of bilateral meetings have taken place in an attempt to find solutions to outstanding issues for compliance with the agreements based on the document presented by the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (Frente Farabundo Martí para la Liberación Nacional, FMLN) to the Security Council and Secretary General on 16 July, setting out what are in its opinion 15 priority outstanding points to be implemented by the Government of El Salvador, to which a further four were added.
The review and search for solutions to these points, with which the government explicitly indicated its desire to comply, was bearing fruit. However, in some instances there remains much work to be done, as is the case with the Land Transfer Programme, which has currently only reached around 10% of the planned target. In others, legislative decrees are required and are currently pending approval by the Legislative Assembly, while other points are currently being implemented. Finally, some points have required decisive government action, while others have simply been implemented.
Following this exercise, both parties agreed that points that have already been dealt with and routine matters must not be included in the meeting scheduled with the president. Instead, only those that, not being specifically covered in the agreements and whose solution can deliver progress in the peace and reconciliation process, require a political solution at the presidential level should be included. These points will be dealt with outside the agreements and will be included in Items 7 and 10 for youth veterans.

5. Guarantee the civil nature of PNC and its autonomy with respect to the Armed Forces.
... In the complementary agreements dated 22 December 1992, it was agreed, as expressed in the letters sent regarding the matter by Iqbal Riza, at the time Special Representative of the Secretary General, on 23 December 1992, that military members of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) and UEA were only authorised to enter PNC based on their technical qualifications, subject to permanent separation from the armed forces and only under exceptional circumstances, without setting a precedent.
The current staff and teams of IACHR and UEA will be incorporated into PNC in this way to form the initial core of the criminal and antinarcotics investigation divisions, respectively, incorporated not as whole units, but as individual teams and staff. FMLN reiterates its position that only staff of IACHR and UEA as of 22 December 1992 can be transferred and will be assessed by the Director of PNC with verification by ONUSAL prior to joining, based on criteria of professional competence and aptitude to perform the corresponding role in the new civil police body. Following evaluation, they must also pass the specifically designed ANSP course for the doctrine and other conceptual elements of PNC, as set out in the aforementioned agreements on 22 December.

Page 7, G. FUNDING
15. Achieving the remaining funding
The government is using its own resources to meet the financial requirements derived from the agreements: it has provided SVC 36 million for the operations of ANSP, SVC 176 million for PNC and SVC 40 million for TSE. Financial support from the international community has been less than envisaged and slow in arriving.
The Secretary General of the United Nations will continue to support the government’s efforts to obtain the necessary resources.

1. Complete publication of the armed forces doctrine

2. Move ANSP to its permanent building.
The ANSP facilities in Comalapa have reached a high degree of satisfactory functionality, as shown by the events for the first anniversary of ANSP and the launch of the new infrastructure for its facilities in Comalapa on 7 September. As such, it is not deemed necessary to start the infrastructure works for construction of the final ANSP site due to the high cost.
3. Issue the exemptions required to import FMLN vehicles.

Whereas on 24 April 1991, the process of direct negotiation began between the Government of the Republic of Guatemala and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG), the Parties having pledged that the political agreements reached would reflect the legitimate aspirations of all Guatemalans and would be drawn up in accordance with the constitutional framework in force and with the El Escorial agreements, in which URNG and the country's political parties had pledged to promote such reforms of the Political Constitution of the Republic as were necessary for the reconciliation of all Guatemalans, the ending of the internal armed conflict, the peaceful solution of the nation's problems by political means and full respect for and application of the law,

Page 2, A. Constitutional reforms contained in the Agreement on Identity and Rights of Indigenous Peoples
4. This Agreement provides for constitutional recognition of the identity of the Maya, Garifuna and Xinca peoples and, from that standpoint, of the need to define and characterize the Guatemalan State as being one of national unity and multi-ethnic, multicultural and multilingual in nature. It is not just a matter of recognizing the existence and identity of various ethnic groups, as article 66 of the Constitution currently does, but of recognizing that the very make-up of society, without prejudice to the unity of the nation and the State, is characterized in that way; this also entails recognizing the specific nature of indigenous people's spirituality as an essential component of their world view and of the transmission of their values, and granting official constitutional recognition to indigenous languages as one of the mainstays of national culture and as a vehicle for acquiring and transmitting indigenous people's world view, knowledge and cultural values.

Page 3, A. Constitutional reforms contained in the Agreement on Identity and Rights of Indigenous Peoples, Identity of the Maya, Official recognition of indigenous languages
7. Sponsor in the Congress of the Republic, in accordance with the conclusions of the Official Recognition Commission established under the Agreement on Identity and Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the necessary constitutional amendments arising out of the Commission's work.

Page 3, B. Constitutional reforms included in the Agreement on the  Strengthening of Civilian Power and on the Role of the  Armed Forces in a Democratic Society
10. Within the framework of the modernization of State institutions, the Agreement on the Strengthening of Civilian Power and on the Role of the Armed Forces in a Democratic Society provides for constitutional reforms with respect to the Congress of the Republic, the Judiciary, the functions of the President of the Republic, and the Guatemalan armed forces. The aim is not to propose case-by-case measures, but to reformulate the whole conception of State organs and institutions with a view to strengthening democracy in line with present-day constitutional trends.

Page 6, B. Constitutional reforms included in the Agreement on the  Strengthening of Civilian Power and on the Role of the  Armed Forces in a Democratic Society, Functions of the President of the Republic
24. With regard to the functions of the President of the Republic, it has been agreed to sponsor the inclusion of the following in article 183:
... ""To order these exceptional measures, the President of the Republic shall issue the corresponding agreement. The action of the armed forces shall be limited to such time and modalities as are strictly necessary and shall cease as soon as its purpose has been achieved. The President of the Republic shall keep the Congress informed of the operations of the armed forces, and the Congress may at any time order that such operations shall cease. In any event, within 15 days following the end of such operations, the President of the Republic shall submit to the Congress a detailed report on the action of the armed forces.""

Page 7-8, II. ELECTORAL REGIME
Whereas:
... The level of electoral participation is the result of many different social and political factors, including the impact of civil institutions on the daily lives of Guatemalans, the capacity of political parties to fulfil people's expectations, the degree of organized participation by citizens in social and political life and their level of civic education, all of which are elements which the package of peace agreements already signed seeks to strengthen.
... This Agreement seeks to promote legal and institutional reforms which will remedy those shortcomings and constraints and, together with the other peace agreements, help to improve the electoral regime as an instrument of democratic transformation.

Page 8, II. ELECTORAL REGIME, Electoral Reform Commission
3. It is recommended that the above Commission be constituted no later than three months after the signing of the Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace and that it complete its work no later than six months from the date of its establishment. In order to achieve its objectives, the Commission would have to encourage an extensive pluralistic debate on the subject of Guatemala's electoral regime.
